![Refresher: Pull to refresh in Swift](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcavar/refresher/master/refresher.png)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jcavar/refresher.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/jcavar/refresher)
 
Refresher is pull to refresh library written in Swift. It provides easy to use UIScrollView methods to add pull to refresh to your view. 
Refresher also supports custom pull to refresh views.

##Usage

###Basic usage

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefreshWithAction {
	NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
    	sleep(2)
        NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
        	self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
        }
    }
}
```

###Custom views

Refresher supports custom subclasses of `PullToRefreshView`.
Then, just pass your custom view in `addPullToRefreshWithAction`:

```swift
tableView.addPullToRefreshWithAction({           
  	NSOperationQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
   		sleep(2)
        NSOperationQueue.mainQueue().addOperationWithBlock {
        	self.tableView.stopPullToRefresh()
        }
    }
}, withView: CustomPullToRefreshView())
```

Methods that you would probably want to override:

*   `func initialize()` - Called when the view is created (either by InterfaceBuilder or using init()). Do setup like adding subviews etc. here.
*   `func stateChanged()` - Called whenever the state of the PullToRefreshView changes. Update for example a label's text here.
*   `func startAnimating()` - Called when user release finger from phone and when loading actually starts. Here you need to start your animations.
*   `func stopAnimating()` - Called when loading is over. Stop your animations here.
*   `func changeProgress(progress: CGFloat)` - Called when user is pulling view. If you want to implement some progress like behaviour on pull this method is called.

*	Xcode 6
*	iOS 8.0
